# Read me for neighborhood map project

To run the app, open index.html. You will see a list of markers on a map. Each marker, when clicked, will open an infowindow with more information about the clicked location. A comprehensive list of the map locations will appear in a list. Each item in the list is also clickable. When viewed on a mobile device, the list is hidden by default, but can be viewed by clicking the menu icon in the top right corner.

The app requires:
- style.css
- script2.js
- knockout-3.4.0.js 
- jquery-2.20.min.js

The app follows the Knockout MVVM framework.
The app utilizes the Google Maps javascript API and the New York Times open articles API.
